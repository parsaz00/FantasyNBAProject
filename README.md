## NBA/Fantasy NBA Application

**What will the application do?**

The NBA/Fantasy NBA application that I will build will, overarchingly, provide any user who interacts with this 
application a platform for them to explore NBA and Fantasy NBA topics. In regards to NBA topics, some features  include 
users  being able to keep track of their favourite players, create viewing schedules for themselves in order to watch 
NBA games, and create playoff brackets that they can update. 

In terms of Fantasy NBA, some features include creating and saving potential NBA fantasy teams, adding player fantasy 
statistics and having the ability to view them at a later time. 

**Who will use it?**

This application can be used by any fan of the NBA or Fantasy NBA. Its ease of use 
will also make it appealing to people who are just beginning to get interested 
in the NBA or Fantasy NBA, providing an easy to use application to learn more 
about the NBA and keep track of their favourite players and teams. 

**Why this project interests me:**

As a life long NBA fan, I want to create an application that takes my love for the game of basketball 
and combines it with my love for software programming. I want to create this application so that I have a tool that 
allows not only myself, but others to keep track of their favourite teams and players and also have a tool that will 
allow users to improve their NBA fantasy experience.

## Instructions for Grader
* You can generate the first required action related to adding X's to a Y by clicking the button "Create Fantasy Team", creating your NBA fantasy team, and then clicking the button "Add a player to your fantasy team"
* You can generate the second required action related to adding X's to a Y by clicking the button "Add a player to your fantasy team" twice, creating two different players. Then you press "Add Statistics for your Player" button twice, and add statistics for your two players, respectively, on each button press. Ensure that they have different values for at least one of the statistics (Points, Rebounds or Assists). Then you press the button "View Statistical Leaders on Your Team", and enter the statistical category you want to see the leader for. 
* You can locate my visual component by creating a fantasy NBA team and viewing the icons for each button once you arrive at the Fantasy Team Frame. You can further view visual components by pressing the button "View players on your team" or "Add Statistics for your Player". You can also view another visual component when you first run the GUI.
* You can save the state of my application by pressing the button "Create Fantasy Team", and once you are inside the Fantasy Team Frame, pressing the button "Save your Fantasy Team"
* You can reload the state of my application by pressing the button "Load your team" on the home screen, SO LONG AS you have a valid Fantasy Team that has already been saved. If there are no teams already saved, the load button will not appear, you will have to create a Fantasy Team, save it, and then when you return to the home screen by pressing "Return Home" the load button will be displayed (similarly, after saving, you can quit the application, re-run the GUI and since you saved a team, the load button will appear).
