## NBA/Fantasy NBA Application

**What will the application do?**

The NBA/Fantasy NBA application that I will build will, overarchingly, provide any user who interacts with this 
application a platform for them to explore NBA and Fantasy NBA topics. In regards to NBA topics, some features  include 
users  being able to keep track of their favourite players, create viewing schedules for themselves in order to watch 
NBA games, and create playoff brackets that they can update. 

In terms of Fantasy NBA, some features include creating and saving potential NBA fantasy teams, adding player fantasy 
statistics and having the ability to view them at a later time. 

**Who will use it?**

This application can be used by any fan of the NBA or Fantasy NBA. Its ease of use 
will also make it appealing to people who are just beginning to get interested 
in the NBA or Fantasy NBA, providing an easy to use application to learn more 
about the NBA and keep track of their favourite players and teams. 

**Why this project interests me:**

As a life long NBA fan, I want to create an application that takes my love for the game of basketball 
and combines it with my love for software programming. I want to create this application so that I have a tool that 
allows not only myself, but others to keep track of their favourite teams and players and also have a tool that will 
allow users to improve their NBA fantasy experience.
